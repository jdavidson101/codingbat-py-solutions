This repo contains my solutions and unit tests for python codingbat problems.

To run unit tests, navigate to the root directory of repository and start test script 
by entering './runtests.sh' in the command line

This project has been submitted for credit for Software Testing CSCI 391 course at the University of Montana.

Codingbat.com has a large sample of problems based in the java language with a python variant but the python section
has far fewer problems. This project was set up to add contributions to codingbat's python section in an effort
to close the gap between them, especially for individuals looking to get started with entry level problems.
